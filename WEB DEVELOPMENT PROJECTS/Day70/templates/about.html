        <h4>A Journey Through Code, Music, and Dance: My Life as a Backend Python Developer</h4>
        <p>
          Hi! I’m Fidelia, a backend Python developer and Computer Science student at the University of Lagos.
          While I’m deeply passionate about coding, I’ve got two other big loves—singing and dancing. 
          To me, coding, music, and dance aren’t all that different; they each have their own rhythm and flow that require creativity, precision, and passion.
        </p>
        <h4>My Path to Backend Development</h4>
        <p>
          My love for backend development began at university when I discovered Python. 
          Its simplicity and power hooked me instantly, and I’ve since honed my skills in building efficient and secure backend systems. 
          Whether it’s designing APIs or managing databases, I love the challenge of solving complex problems and creating scalable solutions.
        </p>
        <h4>Beyond the Code: My Love for Music and Dance</h4>
        <p>
          When I’m not coding, you’ll find me singing my heart out. Music gives me a creative outlet that balances my logical side. 
          Singing is like coding—it takes practice and precision, but also passion and flow.

          Dancing, on the other hand, lets me break free. It’s how I de-stress and enjoy the moment. 
          Much like coding, dance is about timing and coordination, and it teaches me to handle life’s challenges with grace and flexibility.
        </p>
        <h4>Finding Balance</h4>
        <p>
          For me, being both a developer and an artist gives me a unique perspective. 
          My creative side helps me think outside the box when coding, and my technical mindset helps me stay disciplined in my art. 
          I believe that the blend of logic and creativity fuels both my personal growth and my professional journey.

          As I continue my studies, I’m excited to keep learning, coding, and creating—both in the tech world and on stage!
